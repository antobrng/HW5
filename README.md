1.	Thinking about motivation for a data science project, write out a clear (and plausible) use case for the Technical Exercise below (following these Conceptual Questions).

=> This project could be usefull for New York Police Authorities to understand what kind of incidents are reported at what time of the year to be well prepared to each plausible issue. This would help them to resolve it qwickly as they could have the apporpriates police units at the right place. 
Knowing the average response time could also help them monitor their efficiency and see where they have improve. The goal of this project would be to enhence police performance.

2.	Refine the following question into a data science question. Note that for some steps, you’ll need to decide on the refinement that creates operational clarity (i.e., you don’t have a stakeholder to ask). Show the refinement steps as shown in Lesson 35, Slide 5. Draw on your experiences from class and past homeworks: “We’d like to understand how much characters talk across the My Little Pony series.”

=> We have to ask ourselfves the meaning of each word of this question to get the most precise answer. What are the charcters here ? The ponies, including some humans or the dragon ? What does talk mean here ? When they hae an interaction with another pony, when they talk to themselves ? "across the My Little Pony series" would mean "In all episodes". What is how much ? Is it how often they interact or how much does each pony talks ? Knowing that, and not having a stakeholder to ask, we will ask ourselves how much does each pony interact with other ponies during all the episodes of the My Little Pony series. 

3.	Explain why state maintenance is hard to do in a Jupyter notebook.

=> State maintenance is hard to do in a Jupyter notebook because you can run the code in any order. Depending on which piece of code you run first the output my not be them same, it not reproduceable. It is made to be flexible and interactive which is exactly what makes state maintenance tricky. 

4.	Make an argument for why a Jupyter notebook is better than a README for sharing a data science project with data scientists that might engage with it in the future.

=> Jupyter Notebook could be a good way of sharing a data science project because you can mix code and explanations, we can create an executable description. Having the code and the explanation right after could be great to dive in a new data science project. It is also interactive and allows quick visualisation.
